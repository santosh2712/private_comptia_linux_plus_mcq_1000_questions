When working with World Wide Identifiers (WWIDs), within which directory on a RedHat server will you find symlinks to the current /dev/sd device names?
A)  /dev/disk/wwid
B)  /dev/wwid
C)  /dev/disk/by- id
D)  /dev/sd.wwid
C
C. The /dev/disk/by- id directory contains symbolic links to /dev/sd, such as /dev/sda. Because WWIDs can be used to identify a device across systems, they are often usedwithin the context of SANs. The other directories listed as options do not exist.
