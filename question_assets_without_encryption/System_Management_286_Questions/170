Which rpm option can be used to verify that no files have been altered since installation?
A)  - V
B)  - v
C)  verbose
D)  filesum
A
A. The - V or, - - verify, option will check the files in a given package against versions(or checksums) in the package database. If no files have been altered, then no output is pro-duced. Note that output may be produced for files that are changed during installation orfor other reasons. Note also the use of an uppercase V for this option, as opposed to thelowercase v for verbose.
