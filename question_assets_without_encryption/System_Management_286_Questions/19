A
A. Making a bit- level image of the partition with dd is a good idea in order to preserve anyevidence of the break- in. Creating a backup using tar is a less preferred option. Examiningthe partition with fdisk would not reveal any relevant information, and reformatting thepartition usually should not be done until the extent of the attack is understood.
