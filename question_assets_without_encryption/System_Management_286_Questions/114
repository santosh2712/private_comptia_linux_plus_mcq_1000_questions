Which of the following commands should you execute after making changes to systemdservice configurations in order for those changes to take effect?

C. The systemctl command will be used for this purpose, with the daemon- reloadsubcommand. The reboot option would work to reload the systemd configuration but isnot correct because it requires the entire server to reboot, which is not what was asked forin this question.
