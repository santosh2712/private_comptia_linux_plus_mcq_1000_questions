D)  find / - perm 2000
D
D. The find command will be used for this purpose, and the - perm option is needed, spe-cifically as the 2000 permission to indicate setgid. Note the use of / to indicate that theentire server will be searched. The grep command shown cannot be used for this purposebecause it looks for the presence of the string setgid within files located in the currentdirectory only.
