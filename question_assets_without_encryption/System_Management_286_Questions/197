When partitioning a disk for a mail server running Postfix, which partition/mounteddirectory should be the largest in order to allow for mail storage?
A)  /etc
B)  /usr/bin
C)  /mail
D)  /var
D
D. The partition containing /var should be the largest for a mail server because mail spoolsare stored within this hierarchy. The /etc/ hierarchy is usually small, as is /usr/bin.The /mail directory does not exist by default.
