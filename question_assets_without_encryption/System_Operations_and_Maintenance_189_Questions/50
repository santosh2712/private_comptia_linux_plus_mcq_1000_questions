When sourcing a file in bash, which chmod command would be necessary to provide theminimum privileges in order for the file to be sourced correctly, assuming that your currentuser owns the file?
A)  chmod 600
B)  chmod 755
C)  chmod 777
D)  chmod 400
D
D. You minimally need to be able to read the file being sourced; therefore, chmod 400 willcorrectly set the permissions. Any chmod that gives additional permissions is not necessary.When permissions are granted using octal notation, the number 4 is read, 2 is write, and1 is execute. There are three permissions: user (owner), group, and other or world. There-fore, chmod 400 grants read privileges to the owner and no permissions to group andother/world.
