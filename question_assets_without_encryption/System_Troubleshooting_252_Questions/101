When managing a service with a Type=exec setting in its unit file, what needs to happenin order for systemd to mark it as successfully started?
A)  The process needs to return from its execve() call.
B)  The process needs to return from its fork() call.
C)  The process needs to send a signal to systemfork().
D)  The process needs to send the running() signal to systemctl.

A. The process needs to return from execve(), meaning that the actual daemon hasstarted successfully. This is a primary difference from the Type=simple configurationwhere only the fork() needs to happen (option B). The other options are not valid.
