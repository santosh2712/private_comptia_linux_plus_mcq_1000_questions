Which timer expression configures a systemd timer unit file to execute once a week?

C. The OnCalendar=weekly expression will cause the event to run weekly. The otheroptions shown are not valid for this scenario. It is notable that Option A containsOnCalendar, and asterisks or wildcards are valid when configuring event timing withsystemd timers. However, that option is not correct because the syntax of the wild-card is wrong.Chapter 4: Troubleshooting (Domain 4.0)237
