While troubleshooting a network service that does not appear to start, which option to thess command shows the current TCP listening sockets?
A)  - lt
B)  - ct
C)  - m
D)  - f
A
A. The - l option displays listening ports and the - t option limits the ports to TCP only,thus making - lt correct. The - m option shows socket memory usage and - f is used todefine the family to return. There is no - c option, thus making option B incorrect.
