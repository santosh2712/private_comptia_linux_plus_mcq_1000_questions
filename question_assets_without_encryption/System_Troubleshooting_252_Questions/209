You need to start a long- running process that requires a terminal and foreground processing.However, you cannot leave your terminal window open due to security restrictions.Which command will enable you to start the process and return at a later time to continuethe session?
A)  fg
B)  bg
C)  kill
D)  screen
D
D. The screen command starts a new terminal that can be disconnected and reconnected asneeded. Processes running from within the screen session do not know that they are runningin a screen session and therefore meet the criteria needed to satisfy this question. The fgand bg commands will not meet the criteria, and the kill command will stop a process.
