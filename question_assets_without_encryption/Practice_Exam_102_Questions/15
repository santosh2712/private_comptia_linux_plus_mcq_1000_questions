A developer is reporting that their webpage called index.html cannot be viewed on theweb. While re-creating the issue, you receive the error Forbidden in a web browser andyou notice that the files permissions appear as -rw------- on the server. Using thisinformation, which of the following describes the problem and its solution and, ifapplicable, the command to correct this issue?
A)  The developer did not load the file into the correct location. Move the file with thecommand mv /var/web/
B)  The file's permissions do not allow the file to be read and the chmod 644 commandwill correct the issue.
C)  The file does not exist. Have the developer upload the file to the server.
D)  The file has the wrong extension. Rename the file with ren index.html
B
B. Given the Forbidden error and the permissions shown, chmod 644 will change thepermissions to allow the file to be world-readable. Of the other options, the scenario didnot describe the directories; thus there isnt enough information and also the mv commandshown is incomplete. Option C cannot be true based on the scenario showing the permis-sions for the file. Option D might be correct but renaming a file in Linux requires the use ofthe mv command.
