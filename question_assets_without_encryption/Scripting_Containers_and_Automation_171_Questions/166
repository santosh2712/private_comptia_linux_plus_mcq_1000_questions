Within a Bash script, you need to run two commands but only run the second command ifthe first fails. Which of the following metacharacters can be used to accomplish this task?
A)  <>
B)  &
C)  & &
D)  ||
D
D. The double- pipe metacharacter executes the right- hand command only if the firstcommand fails. A single ampersand sends the command into the background, thus makingoption B incorrect. The double- ampersand metacharacter executes the second command,but only if the first command succeeds, thus making option C incorrect.
