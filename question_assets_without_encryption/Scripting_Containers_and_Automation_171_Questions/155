You are writing a while loop in a Bash script and need to compare two string values. Whichoperator is used for this purpose?
A)  - ne
B)  =
C)  equal
D)  eq
B
B. A single equal sign is used for string comparison in a Bash script. Of the other answers,- ne is valid but is used when comparing integers. The string eq would be an operator if pre-ceded by a single dash, as in - eq. In that case, - eq is used for integer comparison.
