B. When performing a rebase with Git, the latest common point between the two branchesis used and then changes from one branch are reapplied, thus making option B the mostaccurate. Rebasing does not use soft links, making option D incorrect. Option A is incorrectbecause the application of changes may or may not come from the origin master branchand may not come from the first commit.
