B)  chown +x /script.sh
C)  chmod ~/script.sh +x

A. The chmod command will be used for this solution. The option granting 700 enables exe-cute privileges for the owner. The other options have incorrect syntax, an incorrect path, orinappropriate permissions for the scenario described. It is important to differentiate betweenrelative and absolute paths, noting that ~/ is an alias for your home directory.7.
